Beginning the Etch-A-Sketch assignment from The Odin Project. 
With this project I am aiming to enchance even further my Javascript and jQuery knowladge. I am aiming to build a broswer version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

Upon completion I will reflect on the issues I encountered and how I overcame them.
